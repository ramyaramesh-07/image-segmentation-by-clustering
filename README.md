# image-segmentation-by-clustering
Image segmentation by clustering divides an image into regions based on pixel similarities using algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or Mean-shift. It is used in areas like medical imaging and object detection. The technique groups pixels into clusters, simplifying the image and revealing importantÂ patterns.
